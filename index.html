    <p id="intro">A social engaged art project centering community networks & neighborhood food markets for sustenance, care, and survival.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>  
    
    <div class="text"> <p>Now more than ever there is a necessity of neighborhood markets as a space and resource of community building and essential goods during emergency situations.</p>

    <p>As the pandemic has progressed, community members have struggled. Food bank lines have increased and corporate grocery stores and pharmacies have closed. MUNI routes have been cut, and gas prices have increased substantially, causing more inaccessibility to food/ necessities. The pandemic has shed light on need for community support, and restructuring our systems of care.</p>

    <p>Situated in District 11, Cordova Market sits on the border of the Excelsior and Crocker Amazon neighborhoods.  This area has remained largely untouched by gentrification and speculative realtors, and continues to be a working-class neighborhood with a majority of POC and immigrant residents.  We are proud to have a large Asian, Pacific Islander and Latino community that contribute to the multicultural vibrance of this area.  Cordova Web highlights the lived experiences of these San Franciscans that are largely absent from cultural narravites of the SF Bay/Silicon Valley region. </p></div>

    <h2>Social Practice</h2>  
    
    <div class="text"> <p>As food sovereignty organizers, experimental geographers, and visual artists, our framework is rooted in thinking critically about the production of space/land and the potential for art to be transformative.</p>

    <p>Cordova Web explores how to be involved in one's community, what our role as artists is, and what the role of a neighborhood plays in a city that is being gentrified, and continues to change throughout the pandemic. </p>

    <p>From these discussions, we decided the best way to get involved in the neighborhood was to physically go outside. We met outside Cordova market, to observe the surroundings and sketch. While outside, we had engaging converstations with our neighbors, community members, and workers of Cordova Market.</p>

    <p>Next we furthered the project by creating an interactive piece. On November 3rd, 2020 we hosted a "ritual" that involved community members "mapping" their connection to Cordova Market on a neighborhood map with glow in the dark yarn. The helped illustrate our local interdependence as we imagine new ways to weave together food, space, and community engagement in a politics of care.</p></div>
